This would be your main landing page, and it could contain a list of all blog posts. Each post would include the title, a preview of the contents, the date it was created, and the username of the author. Each post might be a Bootstrap card or list group item. There could also be a button or link to read the full post.

<!-- Bootstrap container -->
<!-- Bootstrap row -->
  <!-- Bootstrap column -->
  <!-- Title "Home" -->
  {{#each blogposts}}
  <!-- Bootstrap card -->
    <!-- Card title = Post title -->
    <!-- Card text = Post content -->
    <!-- Card footer = "Posted by <username> on <date>" -->
    <!-- Button to read more about the post -->
  <!-- End for each -->
  {{/each}}
